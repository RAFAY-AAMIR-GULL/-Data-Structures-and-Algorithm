# -Data-Structures-and-Algorithm


I have made a Grocery management system like GrocerApp using OOP and Data Structures:

• Link List

• Hash Table

• Bloom Filter

• Stack

• Queue and many others unknowingly ☺ and pointers as well.


A customer can see our products, he/she can buy product and fill up cart. Customer can edit
and delete any item from his/her cart. And at last customer’s cart will be delivered to the
specified address by our employee and customer will be given a complete detail of that
employee. When the order will be delivered that employee will be added/pushed into the
queue and every customer will be assigned an employee according to the order of employees in
the queue.
An employee can see all products and their quantity as well. Employee can add, delete, edit any
product.
